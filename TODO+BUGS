Known bugs and things to fix in this release
============================================

- There is initial support for Linux 2.4.x kernels. However it's not functional
yet. At least the setup/Linux24/oss/build/install.sh file needs to be fixed.
In addition it's likely that the other files under setup/Linux24/oss/build
will require serious changes.

- The Cuckoo files (kernel level ALSA API support for Linux (2.6.x)) are not
compatible with the current audio core. This will be fixed later this year.
There is a workaround. See http://www.4front-tech.com/foum/viewtopic.php?t=2188
for more info.
