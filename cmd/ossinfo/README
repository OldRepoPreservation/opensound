Release notes
=============

The ossinfo program demonstrates the device discovery API of (upcoming)
OSS 4.0 version. The documentation of this interface will be released
at the same time with OSS 4.0 version. While the API features used by 
this program are already available in OSS 3.99.x it's possible that they
may change before the final release.
