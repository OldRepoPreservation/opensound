ossplay - Open Sound System playback program.

SYNOPSIS
ossplay [-Rhlvq] [ -b bits ] [ -c channels ] [ -d devname ] [ -g gain ] 
        [ -o playtarget | ? ] [ -s rate ] filename | - ...

DESCRIPTION
The ossplay program plays raw PCM, Microsoft RIFF (.wav) and Sun ULaw (.au) 
audio files. By default the application will try to determine the audio 
file's format and play audio based on the stored inforation about bit/sample,
number of channels and sampling rate.

OPTIONS
-v		Verbose output. Multiple invocations increase the level
		of verbosity.
-q		Quiet (no information printed).
-l		Loop playback indefinately.
-d<devname> 	Select <devname> as the device (eg -d/dev/dsp2).
-s<rate> 	Select the playback rate for raw PCM audio (eg -s48000).
-b<bits> 	Select the number of bits/sample (8/16/24/32) (eg. -b8 or -b16).
-c<channels 	Select the number of channels 1=mono 2=stereo, 4, 6, 8, etc.
-o<playtarget> 	Selects the play target name if the device supports multiple
		play targets (such as front, rear, side). 
-o? 		Prints the list of available play targets.
-g<gain>	Amplify all played samples by percentage given as argument. 
		100 (default) means normal signal level, 200 means double level.
-R		Disable redirection to virtual mixer engines and sample
		rate/format conversions. Should not be used unless absolutely
